# SSA-ICA-algorithm
This is a demo of SSA-ICA algorithm.
## Reference
[1]  A. K. Maddirala and R. A. Shaik, “Separation of sources from single-channel   eeg   signals   using   independent   component   analysis,”IEEETransactions  on  Instrumentation  and  Measurement,  vol.  67,  no.  2,  pp.382–393, 2018.
## Notations
- The main program is "main_SSA_ICA.m".
- Need to manual grouping since grouping process have not been complished. Using classical SSA, the grouping step can be performed based on the magnitude of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix $C=YY^T$.
