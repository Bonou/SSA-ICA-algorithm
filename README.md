# SSA-ICA-algorithm
This is a demo of SSA-ICA algorithm.
## Notations
- The main program is "main_SSA_ICA.m".
- Need to manual grouping since grouping process have not been complished. Using classical SSA, the grouping step can be performed based on the magnitude of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix $C=YY^T$.

- The decomposition coefficient M should be appropriately large, but not more than half the signal length.
